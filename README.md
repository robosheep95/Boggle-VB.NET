The Game of Boggle Created in Visual Basic

Created by Allen Retzler and Taylor Scafe

Boggle is a word game designed by Allan Turoff and originally distributed by Parker Brothers. The game is played using a plastic grid of lettered dice, in which players attempt to find words in sequences of adjacent letters ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle))

## Scoring
- Fewer than 3 Letters: no score
- 3 Letters: 1 point
- 4 Letters: 1 point
- 5 Letters: 2 points
- 6 Letters: 3 points
- 7 Letters: 5 points
- 8 or More Letters: 11 points
- Although the 'Qu' cube occupies a single space in the grid, it counts as two letters for the purpose of scoring.
- You will be penalised 1 point for each guess you make that is not recognised as a valid word.
- Multiplyer per Underlined Letter x2
- If two or more players find the same word, it will not be scored
